# AVLTree
AVL Tree program allowing you to read and write the words from/to specified files.

The program is supposed to read the english words with their translations in polish language, store it in AVL Tree and then write it into another file. 
The program can be easily modified if the task is based on AVL Tree but the goal of it is different.
